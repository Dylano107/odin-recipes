        topping is sure to satisfy everyone at your table. Use whatever all-purpose apples

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>10 cups all-purpose apples, peeled, cored and sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>1 cup quick-cooking oats</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>½ cup butter, melted</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 
            degrees F (175 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Place sliced apples in a 9x13-inch baking dish. 
            Mix white sugar, 1 tablespoon flour, and cinnamon 
            together; sprinkle over apples. Pour water evenly 
            over apples.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine oats, 1 cup flour, brown sugar, baking powder, 
            and baking soda in a large bowl. Add melted butter and 
            mix with a fork until crumbly; sprinkle evenly over 
            apple mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until apple filling is bubbling, 
            and top is golden brown, crisp, and caramelized around the 
            edges, about 45 minutes.
